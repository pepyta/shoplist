<h3 align="center">Shopping List</h3>

<p align="center">
   Material themed shopping list.<br>
   Made with HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and with <3
</p>

## Introduction
This project's purpose is to make an online shopping list with open-source code.<br>
This is my first project so I appreciate any help or commit.

## Live preview
[Try the project](https://shoplist.ml)

## Getting Started
To make your own Shopping List you need a Web Server (you can use XAMPP for local).

### Installing
0. Download the project
1. Copy it to your webserver.
2. Change $conn = new mysqli("SERVER", "USERNAME", "PW", "DB"); in settings.php
   - SERVER to your MySQL server's address (usually localhost)
   - USERNAME to your MySQL username
   - PW to your MySQL password
   - DB to the name of the MySQL database
3. Change the $salt to something unique (for example encrypt a word and set it as salt)
4. Profit!

## Test if it works
To make sure your website works correctly go to YOURWEBSITE.com/list.<br>
If you don't get a plain text with MySQL warnings, then you set your Shopping List webserver up correctly.
